# Operating System Development Study

This is my mostly worked-out version of the operating system development tutorial [here][Link 1].

I think the tutorial is fantastic, but there are some points where some things simply don't work as described. I typed in all the code myself and tried to figure out the little problems and modify the code where it made sense. If you get stuck on the original tutorial, you might be able to find clarify by studying my version.

NOTE: I got stuck again towards the end. Roll back a few commits if necessary.

## My configuration
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS inside of an Oracle VM
- Bochs for testing
